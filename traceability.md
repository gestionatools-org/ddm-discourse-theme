# Traceability

## 2026-08-10 — Project bootstrap

**Goal.** Stand up a new Discourse theme for an es|public Discourse Cloud instance. No design guidelines provided yet; scope limited to research, tooling and structure.

**Research.** `discourse/all-the-themes` turned out to be an index (229 official + 246 third-party repo slugs), not code. Cloned a curated 19-theme corpus into `.reference/` for grepping real implementations.

**Key finding.** `discourse/discourse-theme-skills` ships `.claude/skills/` — Discourse's own Claude Code authoring skills (~1.7k lines covering SCSS architecture, BEM, settings schema, modifiers, transformers, CSS variables, and the Blocks API). Vendored into `.claude/skills/`, re-syncable via `bin/sync-skills`.

**Architecture decisions.**
- Full theme (`"component": false`), scaffolded from `discourse-theme-skeleton` rather than hand-rolled, to inherit upstream lint configs, CI workflows and the core-features system spec.
- SCSS split into `brand/` `app/` `blocks/` `layouts/` with `common.scss` as a rules-free import manifest, per Discourse's documented architecture.
- Blocks API (`api.renderBlocks`) preferred over plugin outlets for layout work. Discourse runs it in production on Meta and states it is the direction of travel, but it is still flagged experimental — noted as a version-pinning risk.
- Display strings live in `locales/`, functional config in `settings.yml`. Enforced by convention, not tooling.

**Environment friction.** Corporate Fortinet TLS proxy breaks corepack's npm registry fetch, so pnpm cannot be installed via `corepack enable`/`corepack install`. Working invocation is `npx pnpm@10.28.0`. macOS system Ruby 2.6 is too old for `discourse_theme`; installed Homebrew Ruby 4.0.6.

**Verification.** `pnpm lint` green across stylelint, eslint, prettier and `ember-tsc`. System specs not runnable locally (require a Discourse dev checkout); CI covers them.

**Open.** Theme name / block namespace (`theme:espublico:*`) unconfirmed. Target instance URL for `discourse_theme watch` not configured. Design direction pending.
